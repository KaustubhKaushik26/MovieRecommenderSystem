# **Movie Recommendation System**

The **Movie Recommendation System** is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences. This project demonstrates the implementation of recommendation algorithms using **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering**.

The system processes a movie dataset and analyzes features such as genres, metadata, and user ratings to deliver accurate and meaningful recommendations.

## **1. Objective**  
The main goal of this project is to:  
- Recommend movies that are similar to a given movie using content features.  
- Suggest movies based on user preferences and rating behaviors using collaborative filtering.  

---

## **2. Features of the Project**  

### **A. Data Preprocessing**  
- Importing and cleaning the dataset.  
- Extracting key features like movie titles, genres, and ratings.  
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.  

### **B. Content-Based Filtering**  
- Analyzing features such as:  
  - **Genres**: Grouping movies by similar genres.  
  - **Metadata**: Utilizing movie descriptions, keywords, and other content details.  
- **Similarity Calculation**: Using metrics like Cosine Similarity to identify similar movies.

### **C. Collaborative Filtering**  
- Leveraging user-item ratings data to suggest movies based on user preferences.  
- Identifying patterns such as:  
  - Similar users and their rating behaviors.  
  - Highly-rated movies among similar users.  
- Predicting movie ratings for unseen items.  

### **D. Visualizations**  
- Generating visual insights such as:  
  - Distribution of movie ratings.  
  - Popular movies and genres.  
  - Heatmaps and interaction plots for user ratings.  

### **E. Recommendations**  
- **Content-Based**: Suggests movies similar to a specific input movie.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Personalized recommendations for individual users based on their interactions.

## **4. Workflow**  

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Load and prepare the dataset containing movie details and user ratings.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - **Content-Based Model**: Build a similarity model based on movie metadata.  
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Use user-movie interaction data to predict ratings and recommend movies.  

4. **Recommendations**:  
   Generate movie recommendations for:  
   - Movies similar to a given movie (Content-Based).  
   - Personalized user preferences (Collaborative Filtering).  

5. **Visualization**:  
   Use plots and charts to analyze trends in the data.  

6. **Evaluation**:  
   Validate the performance of the recommendation system.
